abstract="The existing methods of predicting with confidence give good accuracy and confidence values, but quite often are computationally inefficient. Some partial solutions have been suggested in the past. Both the original method and these solutions were based on transductive inference. In this paper we make a radical step of replacing transductive inference with inductive inference and define what we call the Inductive Confidence Machine (ICM); our main concern in this paper is the use of ICM in regression problems. The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on the Ridge Regression procedure (which is usually used for outputting bare predictions) and is much faster than the existing transductive techniques. The inductive approach described in this paper may be the only option available when dealing with large data sets.",

The societal impact of AI is on most people's minds. This article presents several research projects on how AI impacts work and society. Three research works are discussed in this article. The first study develops a theoretical framework structuring the legal and ethical objectives that are needed and the means to achieve them. The second study concentrates on bias and discrimination issues embedded in AI applications. It focuses on enhancing the collaboration between AI users and AI systems to alleviate bias and discrimination issues. The third study focuses on the governance of AI, and the study will design and develop an integrated AI governance framework to help guide the design and development of AI applications and facilitate the evolutions and revolutions of ethical AI systems.}
