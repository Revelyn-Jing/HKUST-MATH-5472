abstract="The existing methods of predicting with confidence give good accuracy and confidence values, but quite often are computationally inefficient. Some partial solutions have been suggested in the past. Both the original method and these solutions were based on transductive inference. In this paper we make a radical step of replacing transductive inference with inductive inference and define what we call the Inductive Confidence Machine (ICM); our main concern in this paper is the use of ICM in regression problems. The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on the Ridge Regression procedure (which is usually used for outputting bare predictions) and is much faster than the existing transductive techniques. The inductive approach described in this paper may be the only option available when dealing with large data sets.",

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the way we work and the way we live. The emergence of ChatGPT has thrust AI, especially Generative AI, into the spotlight. The societal impact of AI is on most people's minds. This article presents several research projects on how AI impacts work and society. Three research works are discussed in this article. The first study develops a theoretical framework structuring the legal and ethical objectives that are needed and the means to achieve them. The second study concentrates on bias and discrimination issues embedded in AI applications. It focuses on enhancing the collaboration between AI users and AI systems to alleviate bias and discrimination issues. The third study focuses on the governance of AI, and the study will design and develop an integrated AI governance framework to help guide the design and development of AI applications and facilitate the evolutions and revolutions of ethical AI systems.}

abstract = {Prediction problems are important in many contexts. Examples include cross-sectional prediction, time series forecasting, counterfactual prediction and synthetic controls, and individual treatment effect prediction. We develop a prediction method that works in conjunction with many powerful classical methods (e.g., conventional quantile regression) as well as modern high-dimensional methods for estimating conditional distributions (e.g., quantile neural networks). Unlike many existing prediction approaches, our method is valid conditional on the observed predictors and efficient under some conditions. Importantly, our method is also robust; it exhibits unconditional coverage guarantees under model misspecification, under overfitting, and with time series data. We propose a robust method for constructing conditionally valid prediction intervals based on models for conditional distributions such as quantile and distribution regression. Our approach can be applied to important prediction problems, including cross-sectional prediction, k–step-ahead forecasts, synthetic controls and counterfactual prediction, and individual treatment effects prediction. Our method exploits the probability integral transform and relies on permuting estimated ranks. Unlike regression residuals, ranks are independent of the predictors, allowing us to construct conditionally valid prediction intervals under heteroskedasticity. We establish approximate conditional validity under consistent estimation and provide approximate unconditional validity under model misspecification, under overfitting, and with time series data. We also propose a simple “shape” adjustment of our baseline method that yields optimal prediction intervals.}}
